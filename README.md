## Originally I based this project on this one: https://github.com/daniellaera/supabase-react-auth , but it has become something very different. 

#I'm using bootstrap and react-bootstrap fro the UI, instead of what was used in the original repo, 

# also I added my own auth system using cookies for the jwt's, instead of using the auth system from supabase, 

# the prisma schemas are also different.
 
# still, thanks to daniellaera, for a lot of great repos to work on and grow as a developer.
